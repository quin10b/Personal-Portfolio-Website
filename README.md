Personal porfolio page created by me 

Coded a personal portfolio website to display relevant information about my progress in computer science and 
details recruiters can use to see my capabilities. Integrated my other projects to the website to highlight my proficiency.

Used my knowledge in HTML, CSS, Javascript to create the webpage.
